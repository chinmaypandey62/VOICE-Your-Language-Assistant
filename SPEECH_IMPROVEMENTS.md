# Speech Recognition & TTS Improvements

## 🎤 Speech Recognition Fixes

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Reduced delay in speech capture** - Changed from continuous to single-shot recognition for better responsiveness
2. **Auto-restart capability** - Speech recognition automatically restarts after natural pauses
3. **Better error handling** - Handles common errors like "no-speech" gracefully
4. **Immediate transcript display** - Shows interim results immediately for better UX

### Technical Changes:
- Set `recognition.continuous = false` for better control
- Added auto-restart logic in `onend` event
- Improved error handling in `onerror` event
- Better state management with immediate transcript updates

## 🔊 Text-to-Speech Implementation

### Features Added:
1. **Dual TTS System** - Backend TTS with browser fallback
2. **Smart Voice Selection** - Prefers female voices when available
3. **Visual Feedback** - Shows "Speaking..." status during playback
4. **TTS Toggle** - Users can enable/disable voice responses
5. **State Management** - Tracks speaking state across the app

### Technical Implementation:
- Backend TTS via Flask API endpoint
- Browser TTS as fallback using Web Speech Synthesis API
- New voice state: `isSpeaking`, `ttsEnabled`
- Visual indicators when AI is speaking
- Toggle button in both desktop and mobile layouts

## 🎛️ New UI Features

### Desktop Layout:
- **Voice Toggle Button** - Volume2/VolumeX icon with "Voice On/Off" text
- **Speaking Status** - Shows "Speaking..." when AI is talking
- **Enhanced Debug Panel** - Shows TTS status and speaking state

### Mobile Layout:
- Same speaking status indicators
- Responsive design maintained
- Debug panel works on mobile too

## 🔧 Debug Improvements

### New Debug Features:
- Console logs for entire speech recognition flow
- TTS status in debug panel
- Backend test buttons in debug panel
- Visual state indicators (🔊/🔇 for speaking)

### Debug Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Start"
2. "Starting to listen..." logged
3. "Using Web Speech API" or "MediaRecorder fallback"
4. "Speech recognition result: {...}" for each word
5. "Final transcript received: [text]" when done
6. "Processing user input: [text]"
7. "Sending to backend: [text]"
8. "Backend response: {...}"
9. "Generating speech for: [response]"
10. "Browser TTS started" or "Backend TTS playing"
11. "TTS finished"
```

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Start both servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd backend && python app.py
   
   # Terminal 2
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Speech Recognition:**
   - Click "Start" button
   - Speak clearly (should show immediate transcript)
   - Should process faster now with less delay

3. **Test Text-to-Speech:**
   - Make sure "Voice On" button is enabled (blue icon)
   - Say something to the AI
   - Should hear AI response spoken back
   - Watch for "Speaking..." status

4. **Use Debug Panel:**
   - Check voice states in top-right panel
   - Use "Test Backend" buttons to verify connection
   - Monitor console for debug logs

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Perfect Flow:
1. **User clicks "Start"** → Immediate "Listening..." status
2. **User speaks** → Interim transcript appears immediately
3. **User pauses** → Processing starts, transcript clears
4. **Backend responds** → AI message appears with typewriter effect
5. **TTS starts** → "Speaking..." status, audio plays
6. **TTS ends** → Ready for next interaction

### Key Improvements:
- ✅ **Faster speech capture** (reduced delay)
- ✅ **Immediate visual feedback** (interim transcripts)
- ✅ **AI voice responses** (TTS working)
- ✅ **Better error handling** (auto-restart on errors)
- ✅ **User control** (TTS toggle)
- ✅ **Visual status** (speaking/listening indicators)

The speech recognition should now feel much more responsive, and you should hear the AI speaking back to you!
